# Data Cleaning Report

## Overview
The Titanic dataset underwent a series of cleaning and preprocessing steps to prepare it for further analysis and modeling. This report summarizes the key actions taken during the cleaning process.

## Key Cleaning Steps

- **Removed Duplicates:** Ensured all records were unique by dropping duplicate rows.
- **Dropped Unnecessary Columns:** Columns such as `name`, `home.dest`, `cabin`, `ticket`, `sibsp`, `parch`, `boat`, and `body` were removed as they were not essential for analysis or had excessive missing data.
- **Encoded Gender:** The `sex` column was converted to numerical values (`male` = 0, `female` = 1) for model compatibility.
- **Handled Missing Values:**
  - `age`: Missing values were filled with the rounded mean age per passenger class (`pclass`).
  - `fare`: Missing values were replaced with the average fare per `pclass`.
  - `embarked`: Filled with the most frequent port of embarkation.
- **Rounded Fare:** The `fare` column was rounded to two decimal places to improve readability.

## Output
The cleaned dataset has been saved to `data/processed/final_titanic_data.csv` and is now ready for exploratory data analysis and modeling.
